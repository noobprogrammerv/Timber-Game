# Timber Game

## Description
This project is based on John Horton's *Beginning C++ Game Programming, Third Edition*. It's an implementation of the Timber game using C++ and the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). The game challenges players to chop down as many trees as possible within a time limit while avoiding suddenly swinging branches.
